# Stage 6/6: Ranking PCs by RAM
## Description
It is important to consider both pricing and RAM capacity when comparing PCs. Creating a ranking based on  
price relative to RAM offered can help identify second-ranked PCs with specific RAM values at a lower cost.

## Objectives
- Identify the second most expensive PCs based on the RAM capacity. Find the `pc_code`, `model`, `speed`, `ram`, `hd`, `cd`,  
  and `price` from the `PC` table.
- Use `PARTITION BY` to solve this challenge.
- The order of the columns matters.

Take a look at the following database structure:

## Explanation of the database:
The Electronic Store Customer Database encompasses four main tables: Laptop, PC, Printer, and Product.

In-depth details of each table are as follows:

`Product`** table stores information about manufacturers (maker), model numbers (model), and product types (type).  
- `maker`: Manufacturer of a product in the store.
- `model`: Primary key - unique across all manufacturers and product types.
- `type` : Product identification, one of 3 types available: laptop, printer, PC

`PC`** table contains information about each personal computer.
- `pc_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `speed` : Processor speed in megahertz.
- `ram` : Memory size in megabytes.
- `hd` : Hard disk capacity in gigabytes.
- `cd` : CD reader speed such as DVD, Blu-ray, or None.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

`Laptop`** table contains information about each laptop.
- `laptop_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `speed` : Processor speed in megahertz.
- `ram` : Memory size in megabytes.
- `hd` : Hard disk capacity in gigabytes.
- `screen` : Screen size in inches.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

`Printer`** table provides information about each printer model.
- `printer_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `color` : C for color printers, B for black printers.
- `type` : Printer types: Laser for laser printers, Inkjet for inkjet printers, Matrix for matrix printers.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

** Table names are case-sensitive

## Example

_PC Table Example:_

| pc_code | model | speed | ram | hd   | cd       | price |
|---------|-------|-------|-----|------|----------|-------|
| 1       | 101   | 2200  | 8   | 500  | DVD      | 1300  |
| 2       | 102   | 2500  | 16  | 1000 | None     | 2000  |
| 3       | 101   | 2300  | 8   | 1000 | Blue-ray | 1800  |
| 4       | 103   | 2000  | 16  | 200  | DVD      | 1600  |
| 5       | 104   | 2100  | 8   | 100  | None     | 1100  |

From the above table, it can be observed that PCs under `pc_code` `1` and `4` are the second most expensive  
in the category of 8 and 16 `ram` respectively. The output of the table after identifying PCs following  
the most expensive in terms of `ram`:

| pc_code | model | speed | ram | hd  | cd  | price |
|---------|-------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| 1       | 101   | 2200  | 8   | 500 | DVD | 1300  |
| 4       | 103   | 2000  | 16  | 200 | DVD | 1600  |
