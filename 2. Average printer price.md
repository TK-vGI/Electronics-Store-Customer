# Stage 2/6: Average printer price
## Description
Once you have finished your search for PCs, your next objective is to look for a printer that fulfills your requirements.  
You are specifically looking for inkjet printers that can print in color. Your primary focus is to determine  
the average price of printers in this category.

## Objectives
- Identify the average price of printers having the `Inkjet` type and `C` color from the `Printer` table.
- `ROUND` the result up to 2 decimal places.
- The column order is essential.

Take a look at the following database structure:

## Explanation of the database:
The Electronic Store Customer Database encompasses four main tables: Laptop, PC, Printer, and Product.

In-depth details of each table are as follows:

`Product`** table stores information about manufacturers (maker), model numbers (model), and product types (type).  
- `maker`: Manufacturer of a product in the store.
- `model`: Primary key - unique across all manufacturers and product types.
- `type` : Product identification, one of 3 types available: laptop, printer, PC

`PC`** table contains information about each personal computer.
- `pc_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `speed` : Processor speed in megahertz.
- `ram` : Memory size in megabytes.
- `hd` : Hard disk capacity in gigabytes.
- `cd` : CD reader speed such as DVD, Blu-ray, or None.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

`Laptop`** table contains information about each laptop.
- `laptop_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `speed` : Processor speed in megahertz.
- `ram` : Memory size in megabytes.
- `hd` : Hard disk capacity in gigabytes.
- `screen` : Screen size in inches.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

`Printer`** table provides information about each printer model.
- `printer_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `color` : C for color printers, B for black printers.
- `type` : Printer types: Laser for laser printers, Inkjet for inkjet printers, Matrix for matrix printers.

## Example

_Printer table Example:_

| printer_code | price | color | type   |
|--------------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1            | 300   | C     | Inkjet |
| 2            | 400   | B     | Inkjet |
| 3            | 500   | B     | Matrix |
| 4            | 200   | C     | Laser  |
| 5            | 400   | C     | Inkjet |

The table shows that printers with `printer_code` `1` and `5` have `C` for `color` and `Inkjet` for type. After filtering  
for printers with these specific color and type criteria, here is the updated table:

| printer_code | price | color | type   |
|--------------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1            | 300   | C     | Inkjet |
| 5            | 400   | C     | Inkjet |

The average price of these Printers is `350`. When rounded to two decimal places, the final output is:

| average_price |
|---------------|
| 350.00        |
