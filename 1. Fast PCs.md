# Stage 1/6: Fast PCs
## Description
As a customer interested in PCs, you are determined to find models that provide a well-balanced mix of  
adequate RAM and high-speed performance. You prefer computers with at least 16 GB of RAM but are unaware of the fastest  
models. To ensure a quick and effective computing experience, you aim to discover the optimal PCs that satisfy both  
requirements.

## Objectives
- Identify the `pc_code`, `model`, `speed`, and `ram` of PCs from the market database with 16 GB of RAM or more.  
- Ensure the results are sorted _primarily_ by `ram` in **ascending** order and _secondarily_ by `speed` in **descending** order.  
- The column order is essential.

Take a look at the following database structure:

## Explanation of the database:
The Electronic Store Customer Database encompasses four main tables: Laptop, PC, Printer, and Product.

In-depth details of each table are as follows:

`Product`** table stores information about manufacturers (maker), model numbers (model), and product types (type).  
- `maker`: Manufacturer of a product in the store.
- `model`: Primary key - unique across all manufacturers and product types.
- `type` : Product identification, one of 3 types available: laptop, printer, PC

`PC`** table contains information about each personal computer.
- `pc_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `speed` : Processor speed in megahertz.
- `ram` : Memory size in megabytes.
- `hd` : Hard disk capacity in gigabytes.
- `cd` : CD reader speed such as DVD, Blu-ray, or None.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

`Laptop`** table contains information about each laptop.
- `laptop_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `speed` : Processor speed in megahertz.
- `ram` : Memory size in megabytes.
- `hd` : Hard disk capacity in gigabytes.
- `screen` : Screen size in inches.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

`Printer`** table provides information about each printer model.
- `printer_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `color` : C for color printers, B for black printers.
- `type` : Printer types: Laser for laser printers, Inkjet for inkjet printers, Matrix for matrix printers.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

** Table names are case-sensitive

## Example

_PC Table Example:_

| pc_code | model | speed | ram |
|---------|-------|-------|-----|
| 1       | 101   | 2500  | 8   |
| 2       | 102   | 2000  | 16  |
| 3       | 101   | 2300  | 8   |
| 4       | 103   | 2500  | 16  |
| 5       | 104   | 2100  | 8   |

From the data presented in the table above, it is evident that PCs with pc_codes 2 and 4 possess ram sizes equal to  
or greater than 16 GB. The output of the table after identifying PCs having ram sizes equal to or greater than 16 GB:

| pc_code | model | speed | ram |
|---------|-------|-------|-----|
| 4       | 103   | 2500  | 16  |
| 2       | 102   | 2000  | 16  |

_From the output above, it can be seen that the order of the columns is `pc_code`-> `model` -> `speed` -> `ram`_
