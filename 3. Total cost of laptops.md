# Stage 3/6: Total cost of laptops
## Description
After learning about electronic devices and their specifications, it is time to study their pricing.  
Your interest lies in understanding the price distribution among laptops from various manufacturers. Your objective  
is to calculate the total price of each maker's model.

## Objectives
- Identify the total price of all `laptop` models produced by each `maker`.  
- Find the `maker` in the `Product` table and `SUM` of the prices in `Laptop` as `total_price`. 
- Ensure the results are sorted by `total_price` in **ascending** order.
- Use `GROUP_BY` and `SUM` functions to solve this.
- The column order is essential.

Take a look at the following database structure:

## Explanation of the database:
The Electronic Store Customer Database encompasses four main tables: Laptop, PC, Printer, and Product.

In-depth details of each table are as follows:

`Product`** table stores information about manufacturers (maker), model numbers (model), and product types (type).  
- `maker`: Manufacturer of a product in the store.
- `model`: Primary key - unique across all manufacturers and product types.
- `type` : Product identification, one of 3 types available: laptop, printer, PC

`PC`** table contains information about each personal computer.
- `pc_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `speed` : Processor speed in megahertz.
- `ram` : Memory size in megabytes.
- `hd` : Hard disk capacity in gigabytes.
- `cd` : CD reader speed such as DVD, Blu-ray, or None.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

`Laptop`** table contains information about each laptop.
- `laptop_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `speed` : Processor speed in megahertz.
- `ram` : Memory size in megabytes.
- `hd` : Hard disk capacity in gigabytes.
- `screen` : Screen size in inches.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

`Printer`** table provides information about each printer model.
- `printer_code`: Primary key - identified by a unique code.
- `model`: Foreign key - A PC model is indicated with a foreign key to the `Product` table (model).
- `color` : C for color printers, B for black printers.
- `type` : Printer types: Laser for laser printers, Inkjet for inkjet printers, Matrix for matrix printers.
- `price` : Price in dollars.

** Table names are case-sensitive

## Example

_Laptop Table Example:_

| laptop_code | model | type |
|-------------|-------|------|
| 1           | 101   | 500  |
| 2           | 103   | 300  |
| 3           | 101   | 350  |
| 4           | 103   | 250  |
| 5           | 104   | 200  |

_Product table Example:_

| maker   | model |
|---------|-------|
| Apple   | 101   |
| Apple   | 102   |
| Samsung | 103   |
| Samsung | 104   |

The tables above are interconnected using the `model` number as a key. For instance, when calculating the total price  
of the `Apple` laptop models, we add the prices of two distinct models (`500` + `350`) to arrive at a total of `850`.  
It's important to note that only the price associated with model number `101` is included in this calculation since  
it was retrieved from the `Laptop` table. Final output:

| maker   | total_price |
|---------|-------------|
| Samsung | 750         |
| Apple   | 850         |

Keep in mind that the final output should be sorted in **ascending** order based on the `total_price` value.
