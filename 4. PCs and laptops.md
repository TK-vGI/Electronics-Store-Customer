# Stage 4/6: PCs and laptops
## Description
Now, as a customer looking to gain a deeper understanding of electronic device brands available on the market, you want to identify makers that produce PCs and Laptops.

## Objectives
- Identify manufacturers producing PCs and laptops, then count their production quantities.  
- Find the `maker` in the `Product` table, `COUNT` the number of PC-type models it produces as `pc_count`,  
  and `COUNT` the number of laptop-type models it produces as `laptop_count`.  
- Use `GROUP_BY` and `SUM` functions to solve this task.  
- The order of the columns matters.

Take a look at the following database structure:

## Example

_Product table Example:_

| model | maker | type    |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1     | LG    | PC      |
| 2     | HP    | Printer |
| 3     | Sony  | Laptop  |
| 4     | LG    | Laptop  |
| 5     | Sony  | Laptop  |
| 6     | HP    | PC      |

The table counting the models which are laptop-type and PC-type by makers:

| maker | pc_count | laptop_count |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| LG    | 1        | 1            |
| HP    | 1        | 0            |
| Sony  | 0        | 2            |

From the above table, only LG produces both PC and Laptop type models:

| maker | pc_count | laptop_count |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| LG    | 1        | 1            |
